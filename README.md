# BingoManager
HOUSIE/TAMBOLA/BINGO manager. Can generate tickets (as many as you want, can also exclude numbers for which you don't have clues), and also manage the game with some manual input such as clue numbers and claimers. Includes 3 .txt files that update every time the game generates new tickets (TICKETS.txt &amp; DISTRIBUTION.TXT) and one that contains a 2D Array of 0/1s containing information about which numbers have been played. Also includes an excel sheet that can help visualize the board.
